## Introduction
This is an investigation into how an individual’s choice in residence may impact their health. Cancer rates are the main parameter to determine the overall health of each county in the United States. Cancer is currently the second leading cause of death in the nation, the causes of which have been linked to many poor health choices, including environmental factors, making it a very good indicator of the health of populations. A dataset from the NIH that includes cancer type, demographic information, and location for each across the United States is used for this analysis. Two additional datasets describe the environmental status of each county in the United States. Air quality datasets were gathered from the Environmental Protection Agency that shows air quality indexes for common air pollutants such as NO2, O3, and CO. Additionally, a water quality dataset was gathered from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) to observe the heavy metal contaminants in the drinking water sources for each county. These three datasets can describe a basic picture of each US County’s environment, and how this environment might be correlated with cancer rates.
